# üî• Fire Extinguisher Drone using Arduino Uno

This project is a prototype fire-fighting drone that uses an Arduino Uno to detect fire with a flame sensor and automatically activate a water pump or spray system to extinguish it. The main goal is to create a basic, low-cost, and efficient fire response system for small-scale fire detection and control.

<h2>üöÅ Project Overview</h2>

This drone or robot is equipped with:
A flame sensor to detect fire or high temperatures
A relay module to control a water pump or sprinkler
An Arduino Uno board for processing the sensor signal
Optional: DC motors for movement or servo for nozzle rotation
When fire is detected, the drone activates the water-spraying system to extinguish it automatically.

<h2>‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle</h2>

Flame Sensor detects fire (IR light).
If fire is detected:
Relay turns ON
Water pump/motor sprays water
If no fire is detected:
Relay turns OFF
Pump/motor stops
