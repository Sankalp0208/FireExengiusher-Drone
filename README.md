# üî• Fire Extinguisher Drone using Arduino Uno

This project is a prototype fire-fighting drone that uses an Arduino Uno to detect fire with a flame sensor and automatically activate a water pump or spray system to extinguish it. The main goal is to create a basic, low-cost, and efficient fire response system for small-scale fire detection and control.

<h2>üöÅ Project Overview</h2>

This drone or robot is equipped with:
A flame sensor to detect fire or high temperatures<br>
A relay module to control a water pump or sprinkler<br>
An Arduino Uno board for processing the sensor signal<br>
Optional: DC motors for movement or servo for nozzle rotation<br>
When fire is detected, the drone activates the water-spraying system to extinguish it automatically.<br>

<h2>‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle</h2>

Flame Sensor detects fire (IR light).<br>
If fire is detected:<br>
Relay turns ON<br>
Water pump/motor sprays water<br>
If no fire is detected:<br>
Relay turns OFF<br>
Pump/motor stops<br>
